# Turning-handwritten-Text-character-and-digit-into-digitized-version

This project recognizes handwritten characters and text using open cv and tesseract
In this python project, we’re going to make a text detector and extractor from an image using OpenCV and OCR. We’ll use the Tesseract engine to perform the character recognition system and the pytesseract python package to interact with Tesseract in python.
